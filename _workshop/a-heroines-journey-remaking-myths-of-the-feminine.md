  This course will be facilitated in English (with possible translation in
  Spanish and German) Applicants of all genders are welcome!


  **Takeaways from the course:**


  \-Practice tools in character devising through movement, performative writing
  and image-based creation.


  \-Develop a critical reflection on myths of the feminine and how they impact
  our lives


  \-Create your own performance material, new myths of the feminine


  Gender roles have existed throughout history, manifesting themselves in the
  stories that we have been told and influencing how we live and what we expect
  from our lives and relationships. One of the most direct ways to affect our
  relationships with these myths or archetypes is through creative practice. In
  this course, we will get directly stuck into the mechanics of the myths of the
  feminine that we bring to the work, in our narratives and in our bodies.
  Throughout the workshops everybody will engage with one character (from
  Ancient Greece to pop culture) and remake their myth into our own images.
