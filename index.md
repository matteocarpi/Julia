bio: "I work as a theater maker, actress and performer, along with theatre with communities,
  as well as collaborations and professionally commissioned work.  \nThe diversity
  of my works is reflected in the form they take, experimenting with different aesthetics
  and styles. \n\nI was born and raised in Austria. I graduated in Theater, Film and
  Media Studies from the University of Vienna with a focus on Theatre Pedagogy and
  was trained as an actress at Drama College Vienna. I then went onto create my own
  work before going onto taking my Masters degree in Devising Theatre and Performance
  at LISPA Berlin in collaboration with Rose Bruford College London, where I graduated
  with Distinction. Later, I toured China as Puppeteer and Co-Director with Little
  Orange Castle Theatre & Theatro Piccolo. Recently, I embarked on a national tour
  of India with The Whilst Walking Theatre Festival as an Actress. My two recent creations
  are YouÂ´ve met your match and Persephone-Dancing with the Shadows.\n\nMy work uses
  a strong visual language, combining disciplines with non-linear forms of narration
  and collaboration. \n\nThe idea of the Poetic Body and the practice of Embodied
  Movement are at the core of my work. I begin with physical expression through movement.
  Then used to develop text, images and characters. \n\nIn doing so, I often work
  with personal stories and experiences. Later inspiring me to transform the material
  into masks, a process of transposition and universal connections.\n\nI want to challenge
  audiences and evoke an imagination towards the world of abstract, stylized, or grotesque
  forms. Subverting conventional perspectives of reality through the process of play.\n\nI'm
  interested in how an audience dives into a sensory experience. An interdisciplinary
  approach in my work combines movement, drama, video and stage design as complementary,
  interconnected disciplines. \n\nText, movement and images are an instrument for
  poetry. Through the use of video in a theater space, I open up new worlds and question
  the traditional forms of narrative. \n\nI work with intimate collaborations. I believe
  we need countering concepts to the prevailing hierarchies and power structures in
  society. If we do not want to destroy this world any more, then it is necessary
  to go other ways than the capitalist means that lead to exploitation. \n\nIt raises
  the question of how we want to live together as a society and how we want to treat
  each other as human beings. Ultimately, my way of working questions how we want
  to live in this world.\n\nThrough our strength in will and self-responsibility,
  I believe in the power of the collective. "
