bio: "\nJulia Vandehof is a theatre maker, actress and performer. She lives and works
  in Berlin and Vienna. Her work uses a strong visual language with non-linear forms
  of narration. Her interdisciplinary approach combines movement, drama, video and
  stage design acting as complementary, interconnected disciplines. Her focus is on
  collaborative devising, exploring the idea of the poetic body and the practice of
  embodied movement.\n\nJulia was born and raised in Austria. She graduated in Theatre,
  Film and Media Studies from the University of Vienna with a focus on Theatre Pedagogy
  and was trained as an actress at Drama College Vienna. After working in these areas
  and creating her first own piece Die Löwen sind den Schmetterlingen nicht lästig,
  she then went on to taking her Masters degree in Devised Theatre and Performance
  at LISPA Berlin in collaboration with Rose Bruford College London, where she graduated
  with Distinction. Later, she toured China as a Puppeteer and Co-Director with Little
  Orange Castle Theatre & Theatro Piccolo. Recently, she embarked on a national tour
  of India with The Whilst Walking Theatre Festival (The Collaborators & Bacterial
  Factory). \n"
