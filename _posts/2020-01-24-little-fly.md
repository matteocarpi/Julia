description: "_A light that comes and goes. One shadow. The shiny surface of a metal
  stuck between two lips. Dark. The blurry silhouette of three bodies in the space._\n\n_The
  noisy sound of a sharp bell._\n\n_Fight begins._\n\nLittle Fly is a performance
  project that explores power relationships through play(fullness), surrealism and
  the movement of four performers in a limited space.\n\n_But, what is power? What
  forms does it take? Are we born with the need to have it or is it imposed over the
  years? What are our repressed freedoms? And what is the line that separates the
  power from oppression?_\n\nThe performance is a theatrical movement-piece with a
  non-linear dramaturgy. The creation is based on the use of four elements: the boxing
  ring, the animalisation of chicken, ropes that create disconnected connections,
  and the constant buzz of flies. \n\nThe performance is currently in R&D. A first
  work-in-progress - version was shared with an audience in India as part of the Whilst
  Walking Touring Theater Festival. In February and March 2020 we received two working
  opportunities: in Berlin and Faber Residency Girona. Covid-19 stopped our possibility
  to work with each other as we live in different parts of Europe. We are waiting
  to be able to meet again in the space.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @kein_komplot"
