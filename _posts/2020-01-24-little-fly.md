  _A light that comes and goes. One shadow. The shiny surface of a metal stuck between two lips. Dark. The blurry silhouette of three bodies in the space._

  _The noisy sound of a sharp bell._

  _Fight begins._

  Little Fly is a performance project that explores power relationships through play(fullness), surrealism and the movement of four performers in a limited space.

  _But, what is power? What forms does it take? Are we born with the need to have it or is it imposed over the years? What are our repressed freedoms? And what is the line that separates the power from oppression?_

  The performance is a theatrical movement-piece with a non-linear dramaturgy. The creation is based on the use of four elements: the boxing ring, the animalisation of chicken, ropes that create disconnected connections, and the constant buzz of flies.

  The performance is currently in R&D. A first work-in-progress - version was shared with an audience in India as part of the Whilst Walking Touring Theater Festival. In February and March 2020 we received two working opportunities: in Berlin and Faber Residency Girona. Covid-19 stopped our possibility to work with each other as we live in different parts of Europe. We are waiting to be able to meet again in the space.
