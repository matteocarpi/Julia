description: A caterpillar becomes a butterfly and this image becomes a metaphor for
  change. But what happens in between? In secret? What happens before a change becomes
  visible? The theater performance is interested in exactly these processes; the resistance
  and euphoria; the unspeakable, that first has to understand itself as reality. Visual
  art, acting and music meet and make theater together!
