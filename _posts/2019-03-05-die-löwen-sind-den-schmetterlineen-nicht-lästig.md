  A caterpillar becomes a butterfly and this image becomes a metaphor for change. But what happens in between? In secret? What happens before a change becomes visible? The theater performance is interested in exactly these processes; the resistance and euphoria; the unspeakable, that first has to understand itself as reality. Visual art, acting and music meet and make theater together!

  Something new is about to emerge. Desires and dreams that push into consciousness; old structures that no longer fit in existing form;   Step by step. Sometimes timid, then loud and stomping, euphoria meets with resistance.

  The theatrical performance is interested in precisely these processes, which are made visible through the means of the performing and fine arts, supported by live music.
