description: The piece is a performance and a relationship experiment. As two performers
  strive towards a healthy match, there is a balanced weighting. But what happens
  if one pushes harder?  If one doesnÂ´t give resistance? Or one gives up? The performance
  is a physical research into the crash when you think you're on the same page as
  somebody, but not.
