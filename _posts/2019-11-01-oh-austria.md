  **I am from Austria. - Australia?!! - No, Austria. - Austria? -Mozart...Hitler... .... Sound of Music?? - Ohhhh...AUSTRIA!**

  "Oh Austria" is an artistic research that unfolds between a feeling of homesickness, homeland love and the critical discussion about the "identity" of Austria and the term "home”

  What characterizes Austria? What is typical? Special about it? What makes it my home? What makes it feel my home? And what does this popular term “Home” actually really mean?

  During the _“Viertelfestival 2020” a_diverse pool of artistic positions will be developed in several research workshops.

  An audience will be invited to a Performative Exhibition with Music, Theatre, Performances, and Installation to encounter the individual artistic approaches.
