  The piece is a performance and a relationship experiment. As two performers strive towards a healthy match, there is a balanced weighting. But what happens if one pushes harder? If one doesn´t give resistance? Or one gives up? The performance is a physical research into the crash when you think you're on the same page as somebody, but not.

  The project was programmed as a work-in-progress showing during the Whilst Walking Theater Festival India from January to March 2019.

  The experience gained through the tour will be further experimented in the next research phase. Formally, it plays with a movement score, as well as moments of memory and the push and pull of everyday life. We play with fragmented light sources, which lets the audience experience an ambiguous sense of time in the character’s emotional journey.
