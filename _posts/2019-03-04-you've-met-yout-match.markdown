description: "Devised and performed by Niall Fallon & Julia Vandehof\n\nThe project
  was programmed as a work-in-progress showing during the _Whilst Walking Theater
  Festival India_from January to March 2019.\n\n_The piece is a performance and a
  relationship experiment. As two performers strive towards a healthy match, there
  is a balanced weighting. But what happens if one pushes harder? If one doesn´t give
  resistance? Or one gives up? The performance is a physical research into the crash
  when you think you're on the same page as somebody, but not._\n\nThe experience
  gained through the tour will be further experimented in the next research phase.
  Formally, it plays with a movement score, as well as moments of memory and the push
  and pull of everyday life. We play with fragmented light sources, which lets the
  audience experience an ambiguous sense of time in the character’s emotional journey. "
