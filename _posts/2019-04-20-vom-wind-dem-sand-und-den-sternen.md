  Amir Khan, Rashid, Basir, Alidad, Bashir, Nawid: They are between 14 and 18 years old. They were born in Afghanistan and came to Austria in autumn 2015. In "From the Wind, the Sand and the Stars" the young men dance, dance and tell the audience about their culture, their journey to Austria and their arrival.

  Moving stories, fiery dances and sounds from a foreign world complement each other to create a funny and touching theater experience for young and old alike.
